- bug1 is compilation error. I find it because there are errors in the shadertoy, so it is not hard to find them. I changed line 100 'vec' to 'vec2' to solve it.
- bug2 is what makes the camera seems dislocated. When I was going through all of the codes I find the uv2 unused in mainImage function, so I find the problem. I changed line 104 'uv' to 'uv2' to solve it.
- bug3 is the resolution proportion error. It is because of the sphere function is not problematic but what it looks like is an ellipse. It is probably a bug that causes the view stretch. I changed line 12 the second iResolution.x to iResolution.y.
- bug4 is caused by reflect function in line 78. I find it because the texture of all the objects are problematic: it is not a glassial texture, which means the second raycast is problematic because is can't correctly find the reflection. I changed line 78 to 'reflect(dir, nor)' to get the correct out raycast.
- bug5 is the black and white grids on the ground, the number mismatches what is in the video. I come to the answer when I realizes it is because those are too far from the screen got cliped by march algorithm, because the distance reaches the maximum that march algorithm can go. I simply changed the number of loop from 64 to 256.
